# See https://help.github.com/articles/ignoring-files for more about ignoring files.
#
# If you find yourself ignoring temporary files generated by your text editor
# or operating system, you probably want to add a global ignore instead:
#   git config --global core.excludesfile '~/.gitignore_global'

# Ignore bundler config.
/.bundle

# Ignore development specific files
# used with local paperlclip storage
/public/system/*

# Ignore RVM/RBenv setup
.ruby-gemset
.ruby-version

# Ignore the default SQLite database.
/db/*.sqlite3
/db/*.sqlite3-journal

# Ignore all logfiles and tempfiles.
/log/*.log
/tmp

# Mac's Finder adds these files:
.DS_Store 

# This is the local environment variables used by Foreman to run the app.  These values vary per
# environment and may contain sensitive information, like passwords and keys, so they shouldn't be
# checked into source control.
.env
.env-prod
.env-test
.env-dev

# Ignore powder setup
.powder
.powenv

# Not sure we need /vender/bundle but another dev added it, so I'll assume that's how their system is setup?
/vendor/bundle/*
/vender/bundle/*

# this is my server starting shell script that loads the environment vars, nothing anyone else needs to care about
start.sh
