          <p>
          The theme of this Summit is &#8220;Intersections.&#8221; BZ Fellows will explore where their leadership identities, their cultural heritage (7 generations), and their academic and summer aspirations intersect and connect.  They will also explore their own development and who they are now and how it intersects with their visions for themselves in the future. This theme is also reinforced by the community leaders who attend the Summit as part of leadership and career panels, who will draw focus on to the intersections of interests, career passions, and ways of giving back to the world that they share with BZ students. Furthermore, a focus on &#8220;story of us&#8221; and &#8220;story of now&#8221; will draw more community connections among BZ students across different university campuses and what they can to together as a community of leaders.
