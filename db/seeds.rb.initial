      known for certain things, a résumé reflects your own personal brand and
      represents what you stand for as a leader and as a professional. It\'s one
      of the most important professional documents that represents you.</p>
      <p>A good résumé will help you to open doors to interviews for competitive
      internships and job opportunities. Your objective in crafting a résumé is
      to set yourself apart from hundreds or thousands of other candidates and
      position yourself as a unique candidate.</p>
      <p>We’re going to meet Louis, Eric, and Amanda. They are all sophomore
      students at UC Berkeley and are competing for the same summer internship
      in education in DC over the summer and have all created their résumés.
      Based on their résumés, we\'re going to have you predict which one has the
      best shot and scoring an interview.</p>

    Eric’s experience section does an OK job to list out bulleted
    descriptions. However, Eric does 2 things that stand in the way of
    super-charging his résumé. First, he uses passive voice (i.e., " Feedback was
    collected and organized in a Committee I lead") versus active action verbs
    "Organized and coordinated a feedback process" that give his résumé a
    stronger, leadership stance. Second, he doesn\'t include enough specific and
    concrete details/numbers in his descriptions of his résumé. For example, he
    could include the number of residents he helped to organize to strengthen the
    impact of this section.</p>

          <h3>Theme: Intersections</h3>
          <p>We are looking to convene all Beyond Z Fellows for a Midpoint Summit on Saturday, April 12 in San Francisco. Fellows will receive an opportunity to synthesize lessons and reflections thus far in the Academy, while practicing their skills in networking and interviewing.</p>
          <p>
          The theme of this Summit is &#8220;Intersections.&#8221; BZ Fellows will explore where their leadership identities, their cultural heritage (7 generations), and their academic and summer aspirations intersect and connect.  They will also explore their own development and who they are now and how it intersects with their visions for themselves in the future. This theme is also reinforced by the community leaders who attend the Summit as part of leadership and career panels, who will draw focus on to the intersections of interests, career passions, and ways of giving back to the world that they share with BZ students. Furthermore, a focus on &#8220;story of us&#8221; and &#8220;story of now&#8221; will draw more community connections among BZ students across different university campuses and what they can to together as a community of leaders.
