    "Beyond Z introduced me into the real world and how things work outside of academics! My interviewing skills have definitely grown and developed through my time at BZ. The networking I have done has exceeded any other time of my life, I have met some incredible people and stayed in touch with many of them. My decision to enter the Education field has been reinforced through my time at BZ as well, and all the connections I have made have impacted the way in which I think of approaching certain matters!"

I really appreciated this opportunity, it was a great learning experience in regards to leadership for me as a project manager."

      <p>“All young people should be able to dream without boundaries. I am excited to be an inaugural partner with Beyond Z because they will give students in our district the experiences, networks, and relationships that will empower them to become leaders in our communities, our nation, and the world. The Beyond Z curriculum and programming can help to level the playing field for under-represented populations lacking resources and human capital necessary to reach the highest levels of leadership.&rdquo;</p>
