<h1>Automatic Campaign Mapping</h1>

<p>This mapping sets automatic campaign mapping new sign ups based on the fields they enter.</p>

<p>When a new users' account is activated, if their information matches a row here, they will be converted to a contact on the Salesforce side automatically <!-- note this is done by a separate Apex trigger on that end --> and then added to the given campaign without any manual intervention.</p>

<p>Get the Campaign ID from Salesforce by going to it and copy/pasting the id out of the URL. It is all the stuff after the final / but before a ?, if present. It'll look something like <tt>7011700000056Pf</tt></p>

<p>University name is set on university partners and undergrad students. BZ region is set on employers and coaches. Thus, you should only use one or the other field.</p>

<p>For example, a Leadership Coach should have a blank university name. Only the region column should be filled. By contrast, a student should have a blank BZ Region, with a university name filled instead.</p>

<p>Calendar Email and URL is used for event_volunteer applicants to map the email of the owner of the calendar they signed up on to a BZ Region and Campaign.  Setting it for other applicant types will have no effect.</p>

<p>Make sure you check the form for the spelling of the fields, as they need to match exactly.</p>

<p>Braven Champions are also mapped through this spreadsheet. Set the Campaign ID correctly, but then set applicant type to "braven_champion" and you can leave the other fields blank.</p>
